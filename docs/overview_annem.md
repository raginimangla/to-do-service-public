# Overview: To-Do Service API

Are you looking for a quick and easy way for your users to keep track of assigned tasks and their due dates? The To-Do service provides a cloud-hosted task list where users can post tasks and receive reminders of those tasks before they're due. It's easy to add new users, assign tasks, and edit information. The To-Do Service is versatile, and can be used for work or leisure needs.

For example, you can:

* [Add new members](tutorials/enroll-a-new-user) to a club

* Easily [update users](tutorials/update-user-info) and [tasks](tutorials/update-a-task)

* Pull tasks by [due date](tutorials/get-task-by-due-date) and [category](tutorials/get-task-by-property.md)

Learn about the To-Do Service in this documentation, where you'll find a list of common [API References](index.md#api-reference-docs), [Tutorials](index.md#tutorials), and more.

Test out how easy it is with our [Update a user's name](tutorials/update_a_users_name) tutorial.
